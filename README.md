# OnTheMap
Built an app that posts user-generated location information to a shared map, pulling the locations of fellow Nanodegree students, with custom messages about themselves or their learning experience.

# How to run

First, clone the app to a local directory:

```
mkdir OnTheMap
git clone https://github.com/y4a6n8g/OnTheMap.git
```

Open the app in XCode, and run. All the dependecies are included in this repository so no other commands are needed!
